# Emitte Icons

Icons on top of Lucide Lab to be used on Emitte projects

## Lucide Lab

Lucide Lab is a project with icons that are nicely designed but have unknown use cases.
These icons are released in this package to "explore" the use cases of these icons.

Eventually, if there are valid use cases these icons can be merged into the main Lucide project and will be available in all official packages.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @lucide/lab
```

```sh
yarn add @lucide/lab
```

```sh
pnpm install @lucide/lab
```

## Usage
